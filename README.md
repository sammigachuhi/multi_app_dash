# Multi-page Dash App

This is my first multi-page Dash app, and also using git bash in Pycharm!

I also faced this error when I had already created the `ReadMe` file online

```commandline
git push origin main
To https://github.com/sammigachuhi/multi_app_dash.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/sammigachuhi/multi_app_dash.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

```
But sorted it out by using `git pull`

Created local branch TDW-999-testing-gx

Testing pushing to remote branch TDW-999-testing-gx

Testing pushing changes from local branch TDW-999-trial to remote branch TDW-999-testing-gx.

NB: Testing pushing changes from local branch TDW-999-trial to remote branch TDW-999-testing-gx second trial.
